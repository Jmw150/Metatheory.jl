"""
Rules defined as `left_hand --> right_hand` are
called *symbolic rewrite* rules. Application of a *rewrite* Rule
is a replacement of the `left_hand` pattern with
the `right_hand` substitution, with the correct instantiation
of pattern variables. Function call symbols are not treated as pattern
variables, all other identifiers are treated as pattern variables.
Literals such as `5, :e, "hello"` are not treated as pattern
variables.

@rule ~a * ~b --> ~b * ~a
